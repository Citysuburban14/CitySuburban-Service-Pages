# City & Suburban service pages

Next.js 16 and Sanity implementation for data-driven service × area landing pages.

## Architecture

- `serviceCluster`: workbook-defined group such as Heating, Cooling, or Indoor Air Quality.
- `serviceDefinition`: reusable service content and SEO research.
- `serviceArea`: Chicago/local content, coverage, map and neighborhood data.
- `servicePage`: one service × area page with SEO, media, reviews and guides.
- `servicePageTemplate`: singleton defining the standard page section order.
- `siteSettings`: singleton for company, contact, brand, ratings, trust and form defaults.
- Embedded Sanity Studio: `/studio`.

Public navigation follows `/services` → `/services/{cluster}` → `/services/{cluster}/{service}` → `/services/{cluster}/{service}/{area}`. Legacy shorter URLs permanently redirect to this canonical hierarchy. See `docs/CLUSTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the workbook mapping, scope rules, and publishing behavior.

The original spreadsheet package is preserved locally but ignored by Git. The normalized import source is `data/source-content.json`.

## Local setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` or fill the provided `.env.local`.
2. Create a Sanity Viewer token and Editor token in project `q0tvhxym` under organization `oj4qqrbea`.
3. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
4. Validate the normalized source with `pnpm source:validate`.
5. Import content with `pnpm content:import`, then map the workbook taxonomy with `pnpm content:import-clusters`.
6. Run the application with `pnpm dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`.
7. Open the embedded Studio at `http://localhost:3000/studio`.

## Secrets

- Never commit `.env.local`.
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` should have Viewer permissions.
- `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` and `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` are local migration/CLI credentials and should normally not be added to Vercel.
- `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` must match the Sanity webhook secret.
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `LEAD_FROM_EMAIL`, and `LEAD_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` deliver form submissions directly through Resend without another Sanity webhook.

See `docs/SETUP.md` and `docs/SOURCE_ANALYSIS.md` for deployment and source-audit details.

## Current migration status

- The application skeleton is duplicated from the Highlights Chicago implementation.
- Branding defaults, Studio configuration, and shared templates now use City & Suburban red and navy.
- The inherited `data/source-content.json` remains reference/demo content and must not be imported into the new Sanity project until it is replaced by approved City & Suburban service and area content. The importer now blocks this legacy payload automatically.
